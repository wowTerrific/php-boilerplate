# php-boilerplate

This will soon be an easy-to-use boilerplate to quickly create responsive websites using PHP

####Next:
 - need relative file path for 'create.php' to work - would also be nice not to use shell script if possible
 - condense pages - should not include full head & footer - only content for 'body.' Let 'header.php' and 'footer.php' add that code.
