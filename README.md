# php-boilerplate

This will soon be an easy-to-use boilerplate to quickly create responsive websites using PHP

#### Next:
 - test 'includes.php' and apply to files in src/
 - test/ is current target directory for 'create.php'
 - condense pages - should not include full head & footer - only content for 'body.' Let 'header.php' and 'footer.php' add that code.
